Code1- Get the coordinates of the moon for 30 days from a specific day â€“ right ascension, declination, latitude, and longitude.
Code2 - get the coordinates of the Alcyone for 23 years - ra, dec, lat and lon.
Code3_Part1 - compute the angular separation vs time for N = 100,10,1
#date sun_lat, sun_lon, moon_lat, moon_lon, moon_angsep.
Code3_Part2 - For a period of 100 years, sample the position (lat, lon, for that epoch) of the sun and moon every n day.
